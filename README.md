# Tetris 2025

An update on my [Tetris 2023](https://github.com/rdancer/tetris-2023) project, with current-day LLMs.

The project was completed almost entirely by prompt engineering, first by Grok v3 and then by various OpenAI models. SVG assets have all been generated with ChatGPT assistance.

## Gameplay

Use cursor keys and `SPACE`.

## Autoplay

the `Auto` button toggles self-play.

## Known issues / limitations

* the colours of the tetrominos may or may not be correct
* high score should never be updated when autoplay was used in a game
* autoplay sometimes crashes
* layout is not great, this is even more true for mobile
* OpenGraph doesn't work
